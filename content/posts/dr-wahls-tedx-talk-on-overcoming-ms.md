[Dr. Terry Wahls' TEDx Iowa City presentation](http://www.thewahlsfoundation.com/dr-wahls-gives-tedx-talk-on-overcoming-multiple-sclerosis/) is the best TED talk _ever_. Take 18 minutes out of your life to watch; you won't regret it.

> "Between the unexpected, unpleasant events in our lives and our response to those events is a space, and in that space we have a choice in deciding what our response will be. We can either give up or get up each day and do our best."
