Very nicely done. A few extra powered USB 2.0 ports would be nice to have on my desk. Question is, what powers them? Is there another wall wart involved, or what?

Looks too short to accommodate anything but those new slim aluminum keyboards, but if I ever get one of those, I might need one of these too.
