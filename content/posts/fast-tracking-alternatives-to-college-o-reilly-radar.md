Definitely thought-provoking. The comments are mostly worth reading. Look for Nick Aubert’s comment on people missing the point of a liberal-arts education and its accompanying “shared viewpoints”.

Now that I am peripherally involved in a technician-type education program (lab instructor for EMT classes), I can see some elements of my own education that are lacking in this vocational education. Sridhar has a brilliant idea, here; the trick is figuring out how to tweak it, or supplement it elsewhere in the person’s life, to make sure that the “work basics” aren’t all they end up with.
