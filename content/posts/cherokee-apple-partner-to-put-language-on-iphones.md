Cherokee is now a language option on Macs, iPods Touch, iPhones, and iPads.

MacOS has supported Cherokee since 2003, but iOS has only supported it since version 4.1. I would not be surprised at all to see Apple do a big push to translate iOS even more widely in the next year or two. (AP story, on Yahoo! News)
