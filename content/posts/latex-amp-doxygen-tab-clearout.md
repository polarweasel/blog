I am working on API docs in Doxygen these days, and using it to produce HTML and PDF docs. The goal is zero post-processing, so I’m getting way too involved in LaTeX to make that happen. Herewith, the reference material I keep coming across in my searches.

[Doxygen commands](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html) is what it says it is.

[Doxymacs](http://doxymacs.sourceforge.net/) is a Doxygen mode for emacs.

[Getting Started with TeX, LaTeX, and Friends](http://www.tug.org/begin.html) from the TeX Users’ Group, whose mailing lists have provided a LOT of answers so far. Points to FAQs, online docs, and more.

[Getting to Grips with LaTeX - LaTeX Tutorials by Andrew Roberts](http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/index.html) Â is a series of kick-ass tutorials.

[MSc. Thesis - LaTeX explanation](http://www.markschenk.com/tensegrity/latexexplanation.html) Â is a nice walkthrough of how the author set his thesis, laid out one chunk at a time.

[Page layout in LaTeX (PDF)](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/fancyhdr/fancyhdr.pdf) Â is the official documentation for the _fancyhdr_ package.

There are some more. I may edit this as time goes on.
