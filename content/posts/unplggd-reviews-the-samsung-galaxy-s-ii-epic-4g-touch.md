[When Bigger Isn't Better: Samsung Galaxy S II Preview \| Apartment Therapy Unplggd](http://www.unplggd.com/unplggd/cell-phones/hands-on-with-the-samsung-galaxy-s-ii-155056)

First, WTF is up with that name, Samsung?

I find it interesting that Apple's devices appear to be considered untouchable by so many reviewers. This review might as well read, "Well, it's ugly, not as good as its 18-month old competitor, and clearly designed and built by chimpanzees, but it's pretty much better than the rest of the also-rans."

(Are there really no kick-ass Android phones on the market? What's the problem, here?)

My two favorite quotes:

> It's still no Retina Display, but Samsung's Super AMOLED is a category leading display otherwise.

> â€¦

> If we were just considering specs on paper and were in the market for an Android based phone, this would be a frontrunner. However, after our short demo with the Samsung Galaxy S II, we weren't wowed by the ergonomics, and to a lesser extent the material build, finding it best suited for those with larger hands and a blind eye to UI clutter.
