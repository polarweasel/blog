> My prediction: If Apple announces a pill that cures cancer, AIDs, herpes, and reveals a light bulb that lasts 99 years, while telling us the location of Jimmy Hoffa’s body, the Apple Haters will still call the announcement “disappointing,” and will be angry that Apple thinks that they cured cancer first (they’ll bring up an obscure scientist in New Guinea that maybe did it first).  

> Then they’ll insult the people who buy the cancer medicine for being Sheeple and complain about the fact that you have to swallow it in tablet form (why no syringe, Apple, it’s faster, OMG!). They’ll then declare that they will wait for the Android version in syringe form.
