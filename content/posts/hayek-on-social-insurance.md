title: Hayek on social insurance

Why have so many conservatives forgotten the rational, compassionate foundations upon which they have built their current hateful ideologies?

> Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.
> &mdash;Friedrich Hayek

 _[The Road to Serfdom](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo4138549.html)_ is an iconic conservative, anti-big-government text, a "passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production". And yet, the author argues that social insurance is not only acceptable, but a very good idea. Single-payer health insurance is the classic example of "providing for ... common hazards of life".
