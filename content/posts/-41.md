> The bottom line here is that privacy has its value, not just between members of the public, but between citizens and their governments, and between government officials. Everything does not need or deserve to be public. There is a line. And while I certainly would not elect myself to decide where that line is, it does exist. And to those that say such a line is unneeded or inappropriate, I call bullshit on that.

On a related note, I think presidential tapes, for instance, should be released, and the current release schedule is probably about right. Nothing governmental should be out-of-reach forever, but curation and time delays do serve useful purposes.
