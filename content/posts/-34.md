> I made up my mind… that I would never try to reform manâ€”thatâ€™s much too difficult. What I would do was to try to modify the environment in such a way as to get man moving in preferred directions.

 R. Buckminster Fuller, 1966â€”quoted onÂ [What is Design with Intent?](http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/what-is-design-with-intent/)
