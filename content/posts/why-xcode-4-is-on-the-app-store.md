title: Why Xcode 4 is on the app store

When it released Xcode 4, Apple stopped giving it away to folks with free developer accounts. Now you need a $99 developer account to get Xcode. Or, you can buy it on the App Store for $4.99 (coincidentally, the same price as Angry Birds).

From the looks of things, adding a price tag hasn't interfered with people acquiring it:
