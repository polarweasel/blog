I've had a few manifestos open in tabs for a while now. There's some good stuff in these, and I keep meaning to find a home for them...

[Right Brain Terrain](http://rightbrainterrain.com/Manifesto.htm)'s manifesto, written in the pages of a Moleskine notebook. I think I like their [logo](http://rightbrainterrain.com/index_pics/Header.gif) most of all, though much of their work is also pretty great.

The [Holstee](http://shop.holstee.com/pages/about) manifesto. "If you don't have enough time, stop watching TV. ... Stop over analyzing, life is simple."

The [Workisnotajob](http://workisnotajob.com/en/about) manifesto. Lovely prints, too, though shipping to the US is pretty spendy.

(Someday, my own manifesto might find its way here. I'll have to write it first, though.)
