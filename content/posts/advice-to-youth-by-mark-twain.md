title: Advice to Youth, by Mark Twain

I can hardly wait for our upcoming daughter to be old enough to appreciate Mark Twain's [Advice to Youth](http://grammar.about.com/od/classicessays/a/adviceyouth.htm). It's some of the best advice I've read in ages. (I really do want her to read it, along with everything Oscar Wilde ever wrote, for startersâ€¦)

> Be respectful to your superiors, if you have any, also to strangers, and sometimes to others. If a person offend you, and you are in doubt as to whether it was intentional or not, do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your chance and hit him with a brick. That will be sufficient.
