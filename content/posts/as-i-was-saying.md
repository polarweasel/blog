Adobe releases [touch-based SDK](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/04/adobe-connects-tablets-to-photoshop-with-new-photoshop-touch-sdk.ars) for Photoshop. Great things expected, and probably rightly so.

As I was [saying](/2011/03/03/thoughts-around-the-ipad-2-and-touch-based-interfaces) _eons_ ago...

> And probably before _any_ of that, weâ€™ll start seeing people using iPads as â€œcontrollersâ€ for their desktop computers. I canâ€™t imagine software developers havenâ€™t been thinking about â€œtethered appsâ€ already. Think of an application running on your computerâ€™s big screen(s), and interacting with that with the companion software running on your iPad.
