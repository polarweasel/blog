Adobe releases [touch-based SDK](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/04/adobe-connects-tablets-to-photoshop-with-new-photoshop-touch-sdk.ars) for Photoshop. Great things expected, and probably rightly so.

As I was [saying](/2011/03/03/thoughts-around-the-ipad-2-and-touch-based-interfaces) _eons_ ago...

> And probably before _any_ of that, we'll start seeing people using iPads as "controllers" for their desktop computers. I can't imagine software developers haven't been thinking about "tethered apps" already. Think of an application running on your computer's big screen(s), and interacting with that with the companion software running on your iPad.
