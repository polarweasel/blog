[ongoing by Tim Bray Â· Good News-Biz News](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/07/31/Talking-Points-Memo)

Tim Bray's latest blog post, discussing TPM, is well worth a read. It also contains a little side note on the current Republican party, who are largely (and, I believe, correctly) considered by the rest of the world as _crazy fucking nutjobs_:

> Possibly the Republicans are right that homosexuality weakens marriage and tax cuts donâ€™t cause deficits and imprisoning a world-leading proportion of your population increases public safety and deregulating the finance industry is good economics and invading large Middle-Eastern nations (then staying) improves Americaâ€™s security, as does spending more on the military than the rest of the world put together. And maybe the rest of the world is wrong on these things. I doubt it, though.
