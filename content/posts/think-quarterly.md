[Think Quarterly](http://thinkquarterly.co.uk/) issue #1 is a lovely design and smart concept, with interesting articles, even if its Flash interface is annoying. It was produced by Google UK, and designed by [TCO London](http://www.thechurchoflondon.com/).

> At Google, we often think that speed is the forgotten 'killer application' â€” the ingredient that can differentiate winners from the rest. We know that the faster we deliver results, the more useful people find our service.

> But in a world of accelerating change, we all need time to reflect. Think Quarterly is a breathing space in a busy world. It's a place to take time out and consider what's happening and why it matters.
