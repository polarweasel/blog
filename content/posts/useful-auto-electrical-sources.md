In an [earlier post](/2011/01/11/rhode-island-wiring-service/), I mentioned [Rhode Island Wiring Service](http://www.riwire.com/), purveyors of reproduction wire, including what looks to be every wire style used in Land Cruisers (40s and 60s, anyway).

Other good sources of auto/boat electrical parts I always forget about:

[Genuinedealz](http://shop.genuinedealz.com/) does free shipping, and their prices are great. They will make custom cables, too, for a $1-per-connector labor charge. I remembered about them tonight, right after I spent more than I should have for some Blue Sea stuff on eBay.

[Summit Racing](http://www.summitracing.com/) does have good pricing and selection on Weatherpack connectors, among many other things.

[Del City Wire](http://www.delcity.net/) has reasonable prices, and they (very) occasionally do free shipping on small orders. Memorial Day weekend is apparently one of those free-shipping occasions.

[Susquehanna Motorsports](http://www.rallylights.com/) makes very good headlight harnesses, and is a good source for all things Hella (including E-code headlight housings). And all things rally-related, of course, from WRC-spec mud-flap material to Hans Devices.

_To be edited as I remember or discover more_...
