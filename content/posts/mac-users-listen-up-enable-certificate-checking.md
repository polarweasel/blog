[Mac users listen up! Enable certificate checking](http://securityskeptic.typepad.com/the-security-skeptic/2011/04/mac-users-listen-up-enable-certificate-checking.html).

Do it now. It will take you a minute if you're slow, and there's no downside to speak of:

> The only downside to this extra checking is possibly a slight delay to perform the request the first time you go to a web site and when the cache expires. This should be less overhead than downloading a small image, so I'm not worrying about it.

I am very surprised that [OCSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol) (online certificate status protocol) hasn't been enabled by default in every version of OS X and Safari ever. I'm also surprised at how weak and uninformative the warning from Safari is.
