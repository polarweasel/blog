So, an immediate follow-up to the [last post](/2011/03/23/why-sarah-carpenter-decided-not-to-intern-for-elephant-journal/), since I forgot to add it. Sarah Carpenter concludes her [article](http://www.elephantjournal.com/2011/03/why-i-decided-not-to-intern-for-elephant-journal--sarah-carpenter/) with this:

> So, I pass the challenge back to you, Waylon: how can you achieve your goal for inner and outer peace, connecting within and beyond the choir to the masses, how to live a mindful life, without being so caught up in fame and money and dictatorship?

Exactly some of the questions I've had for a few years, now. I wish Waylon success, and think he's a good guy at heart, but I also question his strategies and tactics on a regular basis.
