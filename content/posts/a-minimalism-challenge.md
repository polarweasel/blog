465 items.I still have 77 things left on the list, with a lot of stuff still unexamined. I'll keep going and make the "bonus round" list for December. **Edit Oct 6, 2015**: So much for that December list. Those things and more left, and now, early October 2015, we've just finished moving, and a lot more things left. There's a lot more to get rid of now, though. Moving inspires that, but we didn't have the chance to do a big purge beforehand.
