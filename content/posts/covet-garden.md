I just discovered Covet Garden today. OMG design pr0n! I am currently loving the house featured in the current issue (#9). Go look. You won't be disappointed\*.

\* Other than by the silly "no srsly, it's a magazine!" interface provided by Issuu, complete with "reflections" on the "pages", that is. But maybe that's just me. Didn't stop me from reading a couple of issues, though, and won't stop me from reading regularly.
