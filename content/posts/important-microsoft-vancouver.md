Link: [Important: Microsoft Vancouver](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/12/Microsoft-Vancouver)

_\[Missed this last week in Europe\]_ Microsoft is
[opening an R&D\
shop here in Vancouver](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jul07/07-05MSExpandVancouverPR.mspx), and theyâ€™re doing it specifically because of
immigration issues. News Flash: Most of the really smart people in the world
arenâ€™t Americans and donâ€™t live in the U.S. But if you want to gather a
bunch of them together to take on hard problems, you probably canâ€™t do it in
America because of US immigration law. Canada looks like a good
alternative: if youâ€™ve got an established business willing you to hire you
for a technology job at a decent salary, you can get a temporary-worker visa
here pretty well right away. (Furthermore, if you like it and donâ€™t commit any
major crimes, you can then arrange to stay and become a citizen.)

Canadaâ€™s a good place to build technology. Itâ€™s a good place to live.
Itâ€™s an easy place to get into. Microsoft isnâ€™t stupid. I think this is a
big deal.
