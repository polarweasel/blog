From Tim Bray (read the rest, too):

> The time starts counting when you hit "next slide" for the first time; not when you hit "Play" on the slide show. Now, in many cases, when the audience comes into the room, you want to have your title slide showing so they know they're in the right room.
>
> Thus the recommendation. So you walk up to the podium, hit "Next Slide" and because there are two copies of the title, the screen doesn't change, but the time clock starts counting.
