[Thriving in a wet environment](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/05/thriving-in-a-wet-environment.html)

Seth Godin makes an apt analogy about how things go fascinatingly wrong when wetware (now there's a term I haven't thought about in _years_) gets involved:

> That's one reason why the web is so fascinating--it's a collision between the analytic world of code and wet world of people.
>
> No software design survives a collision with the user.
