As usual, the commenters seem to have not read the article. It’s not just emissions for cars, but also trucks â€” _and power plants_. Also, the executive order requires that the state use more fuel-efficient vehicles _and ethanol and biodiesel where they are locally available_. That’s all pretty damned interesting, and makes a lot of sense.

So, how soon will Colorado, which pretends to be environmentally conscious to pacify the Boulderites, follow suit? Time to write a letter or three, I think.
