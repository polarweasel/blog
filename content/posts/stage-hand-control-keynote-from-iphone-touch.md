Link: [Stage Hand: control Keynote from iPhone/Touch](http://www.wooji-juice.com/products/stagehand/)

Only controls Keynote, not Powerpoint, but looks really nicely done. For $8, it’s cheaper than a hand-held remote, and does more, too… The question is, does it do more without taking your attention away from the audience, or is the hand-held clicker better?

(I like the idea of being able to jump straight to a particular slide, and having the presenter view on the phone, but I wonder if it’s possible to really use it without ever looking at it, like you can do with a hardware remote?)
