So, provided I’m healthy and don’t actually need the insurance, UnitedHealth will sell me the _option to buy_ insurance later on? For a mere 20% of the cost of a policy?

As the blog author (an MD) says, “Would someone explain once again why momentum is building in Washington, D.C. to keep this industry in charge of our health care financing? With a single payer national health program, we would play by our rules, not theirs.”

Shit like this is the reason behind HR 686, a national single-payer health plan. Support it!
