Beautiful movie poster for _Taxi to the Dark Side_, banned by the MPAA because it features a U.S. Army detainee in a hood. Which is something that actually happened and happens.

Someone needs to stand up and decry the MPAA for what it is: a censorship board. Thereâ€™d be mass outrage in the mainstream media if there were an equivalent of the MPAA for books â€” imagine a book cover needing the approval of some mysterious board of conservative prudes, as movie posters do.
