> You wait for the good momentâ€”the infamous first thoughtâ€”but nothing happens. There is a thought of giving up the whole thing, or else trying to crank something up artificially. But neither one of those things works. Then you sort of become distracted by something elseâ€”and when you come back, there it is!

 ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, _True Perception_
