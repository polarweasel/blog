“Where will the car of the future come from? It’s unlikely to come from anywhere you’d expect it to. Wired’s money is on the car of the future coming from NASA. ‘New technology that promises to revolutionize the automobile as we know it is emerging from research institutions and startups â€” and these innovations won’t set you back $100,000 like a Tesla will… One experiment involves small electric motors located in the wheels of the CityCar, a tiny, nimble and practically silent vehicle with wheels that turn 360 degrees, enabling it to slip neatly into tight urban parking spaces. Others are looking to revolutionize the automobile’s engine, not replace it.’”
