Taylor Clark in Slate:

> According to recent figures from the Specialty Coffee Association of America, 57 percent of the nationâ€™s coffeehouses are still mom and pops. Just over the five-year period from 2000 to 2005â€”long after Starbucks supposedly obliterated indie cafesâ€”the number of mom and pops grew 40 percent, from 9,800 to nearly 14,000 coffeehouses.
