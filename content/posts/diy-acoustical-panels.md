The Acoustics FREQ blog has a great how-to on building your own [DIY acoustical panels](http://acousticsfreq.com/blog/?p=62). The cheaper Roxul insulation is not available for viewing in my neighborhood, but apparently Lowe's down the road can special-order it. (In other words, Johns Manville or Owen Corning may prove to be cheaper, even at 4x the price.)
