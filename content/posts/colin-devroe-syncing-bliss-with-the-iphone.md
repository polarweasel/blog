He’s using [Spanning Sync](http://spanningsync.com/), and is claiming bliss. Must look into this app. At $25/year or $65/lifetime, it’s a pretty good deal if it indeed functions as advertised…and if Google doesn’t make the same functionality available for free the Tuesday after you buy it, like they usually do. :)
