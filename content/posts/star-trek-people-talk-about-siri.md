Ars Technica: [Siri is iPhone 4S-only today; where will it be tomorrow?](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/siri-is-iphone-4s-only-today-but-where-will-it-be-tomorrow.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss)

The whole thing's decent, but for now, skip right down to the bottom of the article and read that section calling out the potential problems:

> Michael Okuda also noted that voice input is generally inefficient. "Imagine I'm looking at some photos, and I want to say, 'Up, up, left, down one, photo number 3362, no, the one on the left.'â€”that's much slower than just clicking or tapping," he said. "Natural language is, I think, going to have some significant limitations."

We currently interact with our computers and other devices in several different ways: direct and indirect touch, keyboards, mice, styli, voice, and more. I fail to see why people would suddenly interact solely by voice.

So, with Okuda's photo example in mind, think about editing photos on a tablet, or on a big ol' touchscreen monitor. You could tap a photo, mess around with it, do the detail work with your nice Wacom tablet, and then say, "Oh, yeah: Siri, enhance the section of this photo with John in it. That's great. Now, remove Sharon's redeye, and email it to Bob for review."

These are _Star Trek_ people, fer cryin' out loud! Surely Okuda has more imagination than this.
