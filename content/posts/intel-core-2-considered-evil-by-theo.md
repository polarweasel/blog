Various developers are busy implementing workarounds for serious bugs in Intel’s Core 2 cpu.

These processors are buggy as hell, and some of these bugs don’t just cause development/debugging problems, but will \*ASSUREDLY\* be exploitable from userland code.

As is typical, BIOS vendors will be very late providing workarounds / fixes for these processors’ bugs. Some bugs are unfixable and cannot be worked around. Intel only provides detailed fixes to BIOS vendors and large operating system groups. Open Source operating systems are largely left in the cold.
