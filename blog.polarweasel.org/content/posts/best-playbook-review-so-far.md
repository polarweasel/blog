> Why RIM chose to ship the PlayBook in such a state is unfathomable. The iPad 2 and Xoom have been out for weeks, so there's no heading them off at the pass. Instead, the PlayBook debuted with all eyes on it â€” but instead of a world-class performer, we got the homeless guy who plays air guitar in front of the mall.

One of many money quotes from Galen Gruman's highly entertaining review of the RIM PlayBook ( ["PlayBook: Unfinished, unusable"](http://www.infoworld.com/d/mobile-technology/rim-blackberry-playbook-unfinished-unusable-534)) at InfoWorld.
