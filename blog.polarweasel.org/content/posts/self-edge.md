[Self Edge is Denim](http://www.selfedge.com/)

And expensive and meticulous denim, at that. Home of the Japanese Buzz Rickson line in the US. William Gibson has written Rickson's products into some recent novels; I had no idea he'd subsequently collaborated with Rickson on a line bearing his name. Cool stuff.

Found them by way of [Roy denim](http://www.roydenim.com/story "Roy Denim - the story"), which they also sell.
