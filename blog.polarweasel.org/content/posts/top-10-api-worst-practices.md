title: Top 10 API Worst Practices
url: /2012/08/03/top-10-api-worst-practices/

Programmable Web just posted a really nice list of 10 reasons [why your API sucks](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/08/03/top-10-api-worst-practices/). Or doesn't, depending on how good your documentation and developer experience (DX? Do we really need another bullshit acronym, people?) are. The post also links to their own list of [5 attributes of a great API](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/07/19/what-makes-a-great-api-the-five-keys/). Definitely check out the presentation slides in that post.

Note that a number of the bad things (unexpected and undocumented releases, poor developer experience, inadequate support, and poor documentation) and good things (provide great developer support) are documentation-related. How surprising. Yet another bunch of reasons [you should add a good writer](/2012/06/19/why-hire-a-writer/) to your development team.
