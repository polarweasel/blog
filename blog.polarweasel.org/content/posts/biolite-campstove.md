The [BioLite CampStove](http://shop.biolitestove.com/BioLite-CampStove_p_15.html) is a brilliant idea. Burning some little sticks will cook your food and charge your phone (or other USB device) all in one shot. Nice.

I'd love to own one, but most of the time, I wouldn't be able to use it here in Colorado (or New Mexico, or Utah, or all our other desert-type neighbors). Fire bans, and all. If we were move someplace wetter, though, I'd be all over this.
