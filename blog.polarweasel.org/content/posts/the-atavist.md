[The Atavist](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-atavist/id408059276?mt=8&ls=1) (iTunes link, also available on Kindle, nook, and others) publishes long-form nonfiction: shorter than a book, longer than a magazine article, that they sell individually for $2.99 per article.

Their publishing platform, [Periodic Technology](http://atavist.net/technology/), also looks really interesting: write once, export to a bunch of formats and devices. In other words, give away the app, then sell the content within it.

I love that they point out that it's easy enough for an editor to use, too.
