[Storing coffee \| Unclutterer](http://unclutterer.com/2008/01/16/storing-coffee/).

Some good information in there. I haven't made coffee at home in a fair while, since it's a pain in the ass to clean up the French press, and my hand grinder takes forever, but I might take it up again if I could make it convenient and easy. (I spend very little on coffee in any case, so it certainly wouldn't be for the cost savings...)
