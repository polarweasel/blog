[Dr. Robert Ivker: 'Love Your Nose' - A Holistic Approach to Sinusitis Treatment](http://www.achooallergy.com/dr-ivker-holistic-sinusitis-treatment.asp) is a pretty terrible title, but a pretty great resource. Just following one element of the strategy (the garlic pills) fixed up a sinus infection for me in record time last month. I was already eating Paleo, and I did also load up on the probiotics for immune support, but the garlic was the obvious kicker.

And when I say record time, I know whereof I speak. Last year's sinus infection was four months long. I eventually gave up on the industrial-strength antibiotics, because they were mostly just killing off everything good in my gut. (And boy, was that fun.)
