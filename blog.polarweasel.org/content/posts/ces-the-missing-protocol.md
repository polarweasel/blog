Jean-Louis Gassée on what’s missing from electronic devices today: the ability to _talk back_. I think he’s absolutely right:

> This being the Consumer Electronics Show, we'll see a flood of new and improved entertainment devices, TVs, home theaters systems, security cameras and other home control products. All of which have a terrible time talking to one another and being centrally controlled, or even _simply_ controlled.
>
> Why can't TVs, receivers and DVD players answer questions? Some devices have Ethernet or even WiFi connections and they _all_ contain one or more micro-controllers, but they still resist interrogation. How hard would it be to program a device to provide some feedback?
