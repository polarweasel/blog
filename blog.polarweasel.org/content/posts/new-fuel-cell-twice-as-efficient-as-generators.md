Link: [New Fuel Cell Twice As Efficient As Generators](http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/122049101/article.pl)

Hank Green writes “A new kind of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell has been developed that can consume any kind of fuel, from hydrogen to bio-diesel; it is over two times more efficient than traditional generators.
