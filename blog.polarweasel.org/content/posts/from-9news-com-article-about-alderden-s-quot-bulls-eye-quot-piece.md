The University of Colorado at Boulder forbids concealed firearms on campus. CU Police Department Commander Brad Wiesley says switching that policy could decrease safety on campus.

“There’s no standard way to identify the good guys versus the bad guys in the middle of an active shooting situation. It tremendously complicates the response for officers responding,” said Wiesley.

On the mental health front, the National Alliance on Mental Health says there are alternatives to institutionalizing more people.

“The U.S. Surgeon General has reported that the likelihood of violence by people with mental illness is low ... More often, people living with mental illness are the victims of violence,” states NAMI in a press release that went out after the Virginia Tech shootings.
